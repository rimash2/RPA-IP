## ZOHO TICKET GENERATION.
Help desk agents get inputs from a variety of channels, including phone, email, and spreadsheets, to create and update support tickets. Support tickets are the requests that you raise by calling help desk agents to get your issues resolved; for example, your laptop is not working, or you have internet issues.

For this project, we will be covering the automation of inputting tickets from spreadsheets that a requester places in a certain folder. We are assuming a very simple use case of ticket creation for this first project. All you have to do in this project is to input support ticket data in a spreadsheet and place it in a folder. The bot, once invoked, automatically creates a support ticket within the help desk system for you.

This Project helps one to understand below.
